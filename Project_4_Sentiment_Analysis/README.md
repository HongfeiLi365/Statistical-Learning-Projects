# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

This is a course project I did with Meng Du and Yiqin Wu for STAT 542 Statistical Learning in spring 2017 at UIUC. 

We did some preprocessing of text reviews, including removing stop words and tokenization. We tried logistic regression, Recurrent Neural Networks, SVM and Naive Bayes to classify reviews as 'positive' or 'negative' sentiment. We created word cloud visualization of reviews.

We used R and Python for this project.
