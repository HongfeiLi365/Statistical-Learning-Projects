# Forecast Weekly Sales of Department Stores

This is a course project I did with Meng Du and Yiqin Wu for STAT 542 Statistical Learning in spring 2017 at UIUC. 

We projected the sales of Walmart stores based on historical data, captured the seasonal trends and holidayâ€™s impact on sales using autoregressive model.

We programmed in R.
