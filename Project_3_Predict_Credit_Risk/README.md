# Predict Credit Risk

This is a course project I did with Meng Du and Yiqin Wu for STAT 542 Statistical Learning in spring 2017 at UIUC. 

We cleaned 890,000 rows of loan data of 9 years and selected 40 variables, and used Random Forest and Xgboost to predict the chance of default. 

We programmed in R. We ran our code on AWS.
