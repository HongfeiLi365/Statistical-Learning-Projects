# Movie Recommender System

This is a course project I did with Meng Du and Yiqin Wu for STAT 542 Statistical Learning in spring 2017 at UIUC. 

We created a recommender system which recommends movies to users based on 1,000,000 ratings using Collaborative Filtering model.

We used R for this project.
